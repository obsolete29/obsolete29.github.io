Hello, I'm Mike! I work in IT as a SharePoint Developer/Engineer. I love writing PowerShell to automate all the things.

Otherwise, I love riding bicycles, hiking, kayaking, playing foosball and reading. I enjoy writing about my outside adventures and consumer level information security and devices.

I have two cats, who I commonly refer to as goblins. They're actually very sweet cats. I didn't realize cats could be like this; I thought they were all assholes.
