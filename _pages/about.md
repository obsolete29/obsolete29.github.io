## Hello, I'm Mike

---

I've been working in IT forever. I'm an old school sysadmin who graduated to being a SharePoint Administrator and now my fancy job title is Office 365 Develop/Engineer. Mostly, I just try to write lots of PowerShell to do all the things.

## A little more about me

```powershell
$mike = @{
    pronouns = @('He','Him')
    technologies = @('PowerShell','SharePoint','O365','PowerApps','PowerAutomate')
    hobbies = @('bicycling','hiking','kayaking','foosball','reading','infosec')
    cats = @('lily','sammie')
}
```
